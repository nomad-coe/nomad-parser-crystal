# Unit tests
This directory contains unit tests to evaluate the correctness of the parser in
a systematic way. Ideally each parsed metainfo should have at least one unit
test, and if the resulting values are predetermined, the available values
should all be tested individually. Also certain scenarios that should produce a
parsing error should be tested.
